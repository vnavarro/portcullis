# Chain-up! 

Chain-up! is the january submission for OGAM Jam, it was my first submission to it. 

Play [here](http://chain-up.herokuapp.com/)

The theme was Portcullis, which is a kind of gate of the old days (quite old), check it on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portcullis).

## The Idea

To get through the gate and claim the treasures beyond you must connect the chains from the top to the bottom of the gate opening it.

## How to play

Rotate the board chains clicking on them, yep easy as that.

## Inside it

The game was made using createjs, my own assets and audio from the great [Kevin McLeod](http://incompetech.com/)
